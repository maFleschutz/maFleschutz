## Hi there 👋

I'm **Manu**, an aspiring developer based in **Germany**.

I code and build whatever sparks my curiosity.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll try to build it and learn from it.

Working with Python and Git right now, experimenting with Java when I'm curious.
VS Code is where the magic happens (and where I spend most of my time).

Projects coming soon – learning the fundamentals first.

Still early in my journey, but I code every day and learn something new each time.

If you want to see how I learn, my projects and progress are available here!

**Fun Facts:**

- My browser has more coding tabs open than I'd like to admit
- Dark mode everything or nothing at all
- I once spent 3 hours on a bug that was a missing semicolon
- Hobbies: coding, gaming, googling things I should know
